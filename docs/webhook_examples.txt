Azure DevOps Webhook Notes
==============================

We've noticed some quirks:
- Work items don't always follow a linear path (New → Active → Resolved → Closed)
- Items frequently move backwards (e.g., Resolved → Active when bugs are found)
- We sometimes miss webhooks, so you might see gaps in the revision numbers
- The ChangedBy field isn't always present (system changes?)
- We occasionally get duplicate webhooks for the same change
- State names vary by project template (e.g., "Active" vs "In Progress")

Just FYI for whoever implements this...
